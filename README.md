# Network-programming

This an application on UDP network protocol communication, implemented entirely in JAVA. 

The application establishes connection via sockets with a university server. Each class (Echo, Image, Sound) depicts different types of data and how they are handled from each end. Classes copter and obd are very specific to the project and have little practical use, but are uploaded for wholeness.
